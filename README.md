# My leetcode sandbox

This is my attempt to get better at algorithms.

Most of these problems are coming from either this [Educative course](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview) or [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all).

### Glossary of some common math-y terms I can never remember:

- logarithm - A logarithm is a mathematical operation that determines how many times a certain number, called the base, is multiplied by itself to reach another number. The exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a given number. The inverse function to exponentiation. 10^3 = 1000 and log10(1000) = 3.
- median - is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers. Separates higher half from lower.
- complement - "a technique to encode a symmetric range of positive and negative integers in a way that they can use the same algorithm (hardware) for addition throughout the whole range." How you get one I think it depends on the representation. For example, in a binary representation you can flip bits to get the complement.
