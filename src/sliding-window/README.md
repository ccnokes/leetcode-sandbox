# Sliding window

- Useful when trying to find a contiguous subarray because it allows you to think in terms of a range of values.
- Usually there's left/right windowStart/windowEnd pointers and the "window" or "range" that these two pointers create expands or collapses depending on what we're looking for.
- Usually O(n).
