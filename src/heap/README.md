# Heap

- A heap is a specialized binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where in a min heap, the parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children (ensuring the smallest element is at the root), and in a max heap, the parent node is always larger than or equal to its children (ensuring the largest element is at the root).
- Heaps are primarily used for efficient priority queue operations, such as finding the smallest or largest element in constant time while supporting fast insertions and deletions (O(logn)), making them useful for Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm (shortest path), Huffman coding (data compression), heap sort, scheduling systems, and finding the k-th largest/smallest elements in a collection.
