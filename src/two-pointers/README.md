# Two pointers

- Most often used with sorted arrays. This allows you to have a pointer at the start and end and meet in the middle.
- Usually O(n).
- Whenever thereâ€™s a requirement to find two data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition, the two pointers pattern should be the first strategy to come to mind.

Matches problems like:

- linear data structure - array, linked list, string
- process pairs - we need to process element at 2 different positions simultaneously
- dynamic pointer movement - both pointers move independently of each other along the same or different data structures
